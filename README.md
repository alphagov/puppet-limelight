# [puppet-limelight](https://github.com/alphagov/puppet-limelight)

Puppet module for setting up a machine for the [limelight](https://github.com/alphagov/limelight) application.

It does:
- Create the required directories
- Create an nginx vhost
- Install rbenv and dependencies (build-essential etc)
- Create an upstart job

It does not: (and therefore must be done manually for the moment)
- Copy the application code into `/opt/limelight`
- Copy correct configuration files into place
- Run bundle install

## Usage

### `limelight::app`

```puppet
limelight::app { 'limelight':
	port        => 3038,
  user        => 'deploy',
  group       => 'deploy',
  domain_name => 'everywhere',
}
```
